# go-obs
`go-obs` provides bindings for the OBS websocket protocol (version 4.x) in
the Go programming language.

**NOTE:** This is very much unstable and untested thus far. The OBS websocket
protocol is fairly large, I can't test everything quickly myself. Use at your
own risk; please report any issues you encounter.

# Documentation
You can view documentation for the OBS websocket protocol [here](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/4.x-current/docs/generated/protocol.md).
